# ConformalPrediction
Conformal prediction suite for acoustic estimation tasks

This repo contains code for application of conformal prediction to acoustic estimation tasks.
Plane wave model is used to generate acoustic signals. Environmental uncertainty sources are considered.

At present 3 deep learning techniques are trained and tested:
1. Deep ensemble
2. Deep quantile regression
3. DNN Monte-Carlo dropout

Conformal prediction is validated with coverage and interval width.
